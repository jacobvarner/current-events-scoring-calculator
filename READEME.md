# Current Events Scoring Calculator

This is a scoring calculator to aid teams competing in the 2018 BEST Robotics game, Current Events.

The live version of this application can be found at: [scoreau.org/current-events/scoring-calculator.html](scoreau.org/current-events/scoring-calculator.html)

\* This calculator is to aid teams in planning for scenarios and figuring out how scoring works. While we have tried to make this as accurate as possible, scoring from the official scoring system at competition will be considered more accurate than this calculator. This calculator cannot account for judgements made by referees and other factors.

\*\* The "Current Flow Analysis" for this calculator assumes that any selected letter is the correct letter as long as it is not marked late. In the real game, this will only award the points if the guessed letter is correctly selected and is not deemed late.

\*\*\* The "Flexibility Bonus" indicator on the this calculator is just to indicate which bonus have been triggered and will not need to be checked during the actual game. These scenarios can be found in section 6.4 of the game rules.

\*\*\*\* A turtle must be scored in order for the Sea Turtle Bonus to actually take effect.
